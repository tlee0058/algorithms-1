/*Only Keep the Last Few
Stan learned something today: that reducing an arrayâ€™s .length immediately shortens it by that amount. Given array arr and number X, 
remove all except the last X elements, and return arr (changed and shorter). Given ([2,4,6,8,10],3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it. */

function keepLastFew(arr, x){
    var newarr = [];
    for(var i = arr.length-x; i < arr.length; i++){
        newarr.push(arr[i]);
    }
    return newarr;
}

console.log(keepLastFew(([2,4,6,8,10]), 3));
