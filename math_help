/*Math Help
Cartman doesn’t really like math class and needs help. You are given two numbers – the coefficients M and B in the equation Y = MX + B. 
Build a function that returns the X-intercept (Cartman’s older cousin Charlie wisely reminds him that X-intercept 
is the value of X where Y equals zero, 
but he just scoffs) */


function mathHelp(m, b){
    var x = -b / m;
    return x;
}

console.log("(" + mathHelp(1,2) + ", 0)");
